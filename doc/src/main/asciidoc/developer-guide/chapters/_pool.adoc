[[_pool_overview]]
== Overview


The pool controls the physical connection to the target Enterprise Information System, such as a database. 

It is up to the pool to create, hand out and destroy connections in the defined lifecycle based on the configuration parameters supplied by the user. 

The pool architecture

[NOTE]
====
      Each of the components in the pool architecture can be accessed by multiple threads at the
      same time, hence each component needs to make sure that thread safely is maintained.

[[_pool_public]]
== Public API


The public API defines the API that programs external to the IronJacamar project can use to configure, and use the pool. 

The `Pool` interface allows access to the name of the pool, flushing connections, verifying if a connection can be obtained from the pool and dump any queued threads. 

The `PoolConfiguration` class holds the configuration parameters for the pool. 

The `FlushMode` enum defines the different flush modes supported. 

The `PoolStatistics` interface defines the statistics available for a pool. 

The package for the public API is ``org.jboss.jca.core.api.connectionmanager.pool``. 

[[_pool_private]]
== Private API


The private API defines the API that can be used internally IronJacamar to control the pool.
The API extends the public API where it makes sense in order to provide a more uniform interface to the implementation. 

The `PoolFactory` class will create a `Pool` based upon the passed in configuration. 

The `PoolStrategy` enum defines how the pool is split based on credential equallity. 

The `Pool` interface extends the public API with methods that should only be available from with IronJacamar such as getting a connection listener, returning a connection listener, and shutting down the pool. 

The `PrefillPool` interface defines the contract for pool implementations that supports prefilling of connections upon startup, such as `OnePool` and ``PoolBySubject``. 

The `Capacity` interface provides a handle to the policies used for increasing and decreasing the pool. 

The `CapacityIncrementer` interface defines if a physical connection should be created given the input parameters. 

The `CapacityDecrementer` interface defines if a physical connection should be destroyed given the input parameters. 

The package for the private API is ``org.jboss.jca.core.connectionmanager.pool.api``. 

[[_pool_implementation]]
== Implementation


The pool implementation provides a concrete implementation of the contracts defined by the public and private APIs. 

The package for the pool implementation is ``org.jboss.jca.core.connectionmanager.pool``. 

[[_pool_implementation_abstractpool]]
=== AbstractPool

`AbstractPool` provides the methods that are shared across all pool implementations. 

`getKey(Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo, boolean)` defines the key used to lookup the `ManagedConnectionPool` instance.
The implementation of this method is different for each pool type. 

`getManagedConnectionPool(Object, Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo)` retrieves the correct `ManagedConnectionPool` instance.
If the `ManagedConnectionPool` doesn't yet exists then one is created, and initialized. 

`emptyManagedConnectionPool(ManagedConnectionPool)` removes a `ManagedConnectionPool` instance, if unused. 

`flush` flushes the `ManagedConnectionPool` instances, based on the ``FlushMode``. 

`getConnection(Transaction, Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo)` returns a `ConnectionListener` instance, which has the physical connection to the Enterprise Information System attached.
The method uses 3 sub methods to return the correct listener instance. `getSimpleConnection` returns a `ConnectionListener` if there is no transaction associated. `getTransactionOldConnection` returns the `ConnectionListener` already associated with the transaction, if any. `getTransactionNewConnection` creates a new ``ConnectionListener``, and associates it with the transaction. 

`findConnectionListener` finds a specific `ConnectionListener` instance. 

`returnConnectionListener` returns a `ConnectionListener` instance to the correct ``ManagedConnectionPool``. 

`shutdown` shuts down the pool.
This is done using synchronization such that any components having a reference will be notified through an error. 

`internalTestConnection(ConnectionRequestInfo, Subject)` tries to obtain a `ConnectionListener` based on the input given. 

`getLock()` returns the lock that guards the maximum number of active ``ConnectionListener``'s in the pool.
This method is used by the `ManagedConnectionPool` instances when modifying their data structure that holds the ``ConnectionListener``'s. 

`dumpQueuedThreads()` returns a stack trace of each of the queued threads waiting to obtain a `ConnectionListener` instance. 

[[_pool_implementation_prefill]]
=== AbstractPrefillPool


The `AbstractPrefillPool` enables the pool to prefill connections during startup, and through its lifecycle. 

`prefill(Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo, boolean)` handles the prefilling process. 

[[_pool_implementation_types]]
=== Pool types


IronJacamar features 5 different pool types.
Each pool type has its own `getKey` method implementation that defines how a `ManagedConnectionPool` instance is located. 

`OnePool` uses one `ManagedConnectionPool` instance to hold all ``ConnectionListener``s. 

`PoolByCri` splits the `ManagedConnectionPool` instances based on the `ConnectionRequestInfo` instance. 

`PoolBySubject` splits the `ManagedConnectionPool` instances based on the `Subject` instance. 

`PoolBySubjectAndCri` splits the `ManagedConnectionPool` instances based on both the `ConnectionRequestInfo` instance and the `Subject` instance. 

`ReauthPool` allows the `ConnectionListener` instances to reauthenticate, so the `ManagedConnectionPool` instances can change over time based on the `ConnectionRequestInfo` and `Subject` instances. 

The package for the pool types is ``org.jboss.jca.core.connectionmanager.pool.strategy``. 

[[_pool_mcp]]
== ManagedConnectionPool


The `ManagedConnectionPool` controls the `ConnectionListener` instances, which each has a physical connection (``ManagedConnection``) associated. 

The package is `org.jboss.jca.core.connectionmanager.pool.mcp`

[[_pool_mcp_private]]
=== Private API

`ManagedConnectionPool` instances should only be accessed from within IronJacamar, so they only have a private API. 

The `ManagedConnectionPoolFactory` class creates a `ManagedConnectionPool` instance. 

The `ManagedConnectionPool` interface defines the methods exposed to the pool, connection validator, and idle remover.
These methods includes getting a connection listener, finding a connection listener, and returning a connection listener. 

The `ManagedConnectionPoolStatistics` interface defines the statistics for the `ManagedConnectionPool` instance. 

The `ManagedConnectionPoolUtility` class defines utility methods for the `ManagedConnectionPool` instance. 

[[_pool_mcp_implementation]]
=== Implementation


There are three different implementations of the `ManagedConnectionPool` interface. `SemaphoreArrayListManagedConnectionPool` which uses an `ArrayList` to hold the ``ConnectionListener``s. `SemaphoreConcurrentLinkedQueueManagedConnectionPool` which uses a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` to hold the ``ConnectionListener``s. `SemaphoreConcurrentLinkedQueueManagedConnectionPool` also uses a `ConcurrentHashMap` to keep track of the internal status of each of the ``ConnectionListener``s.
Last, a `LeakDumperManagedConnectionPool` which extends ``SemaphoreArrayListManagedConnectionPool``, but reports any leaks upon shutdown. 

`getConnection(Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo)` provides a ``ConnectionListener``.
The method requires a lock in order to obtain a listener, using the specified timeout value.
If a listener is avaiable in the pool then it is matched against the `ManagedConnectionFactory` to verify it is valid, and returned - otherwise it is destroyed.
If no listener is available then a new listener is created and returned.
In the latter case both prefill and a capacity increase is scheduled in order to prefill to the minimum size, and increase the pool by the specified capacity policy. 

`returnConnection(ConnectionListener, boolean, boolean)` returns a `ConnectionListener` into the pool. 

`flush(FlushMode)` flushes the ``ConnectionListener``s according to the mode.
Any listeners marked as bad will be destroyed.
Prefill is scheduled at the end in order to maintain the minimum pool size. 

`removeIdleConnections` is invoked from the idle remover in order to decrement the pool to the desired size based on the `CapacityDecrementer` policy.
If any listeners are destroyed the pool is either scheduled for prefill, or for removal through `emptyManagedConnectionPool` if empty. 

`shutdown` shuts the instance down.
All listeners are removed.
This is done using synchronization such that any components having a reference will be notified through an error. 

`fillTo(int)` fills the pool to the specified size.
The pool filler component uses this method. 

`increaseCapacity(Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo)` increases the pool based on the `CapacityIncrementer` policy.
The capacity filler component uses this method. 

`validateConnections` validates that the listeners are valid according to ``ValidatingManagedConnectionFactory``.
Any invalid listeners are destroyed and prefill scheduled.
The connection validator component uses this method. 

`detachConnectionListener` disassociates the connections attached to the `ManagedConnection` such that it can be reused in another request through ``DissociatableManagedConnection``. 

[IMPORTANT]`====
        The ConnectionListener` implements ``java.lang.Comparable``, so `ConnectionListener.used()` must
        be called before returning it to the data structure controlling the free connections. There may be a time interval between the call
        and the actual return.
