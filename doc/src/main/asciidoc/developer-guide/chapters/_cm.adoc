[[_cm_overview]]
== Overview


The connection manager defines the interface for resource adapters to allocate connections, which are associated with the physical connections to the target Enterprise Information System, such as a database. 

It is up to the connection manager to use the pool, and enlist the connection listeners in the transactions, if supported.

[NOTE]
====
      Each of the components in the connection manager architecture can be accessed by multiple threads at the
      same time, hence each component needs to make sure that thread safely is maintained.

[[_cm_public]]
== Public API


The public API defines the API that programs external to the IronJacamar project can use to configure, and use the connection manager. 

The `ConnectionManager` interface allows to associate and dissociate a managed connection with a connection. 

The `ConnectionListener` interface provides with IronJacamar contract for ``javax.resource.spi.ConnectionEventListener``. 

The package for the public API is ``org.jboss.jca.core.api.connectionmanager``. 

[[_cm_private]]
== Private API


The private API defines the API that can be used internally IronJacamar to control the connection manager.
The API extends the public API where it makes sense in order to provide a more uniform interface to the implementation. 

The `ConnectionManagerFactory` class can create a `ConnectionManager` instance. 

The `ConnectionManager` interface defines the internal API of the connection manager used by IronJacamar. 

The `NoTxConnectionManager` interface defines the internal API of a non-transactional connection manager. 

The `TxConnectionManager` interface defines the internal API of a transactional connection manager. 

The `ConnectionListener` interface defines the internal API of a connection listener, which is associated with a managed connection. 

The package for the private API is ``org.jboss.jca.core.connectionmanager``. 

[[_cm_implementation]]
== Implementation


The implementation of the connection manager is split in two classes, with a shared base class for common functionality. 

[[_cm_implementation_abstractconnectionmanager]]
=== AbstractConnectionManager

`AbstractConnectionManager` provides the methods that are shared across both implementations, `NoTxConnectionManagerImpl` and ``TxConnectionManagerImpl``. 

`getManagedConnection(Transaction, Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo)` obtains a `ConnectionListener` instance from the pool.
If an error occurs a retry is performed, if configured. 

`returnManagedConnection(ConnectionListener, boolean)` returns a `ConnectionListener` instance to the pool.
If an error occurs a retry is performed, if configured. 

`allocateConnection(ManagedConnectionFactory, ConnectionRequestInfo)` allocates a connection for the managed connection attached to the `ConnectionListener` instance. 

`associateManagedConnection(Object, ManagedConnectionFactory, ConnectionRequestInfo)` associates a `ManagedConnection` with the passed in connection.
This is a  `LazyAssociatableConnectionManager` extension of IronJacamar. 

`dissociateManagedConnection(Object, ManagedConnection, ManagedConnectionFactory)` dissociates a connection with its `ManagedConnection` instance.
This is a  `LazyAssociatableConnectionManager` extension of IronJacamar. 

`shutdown` shuts down the connection manager, and its related pool instance.
This is done using synchronization such that any components having a reference will be notified through an error. 

[[_cm_implementation_notxconnectionmanager]]
=== NoTxConnectionManagerImpl

`NoTxConnectionManagerImpl` provides the implementation for a connection manager configured with ``NoTransaction``. 

`createConnectionListener(ManagedConnection, ManagedConnectionPool)` creates a `NoTxConnectionListener` and associates it with the `ManagedConnection` instance. 

[[_cm_implementation_txconnectionmanager]]
=== TxConnectionManagerImpl

`TxConnectionManagerImpl` provides the implementation for a connection manager configured with `LocalTransaction` or ``XATransaction``. 

`createConnectionListener(ManagedConnection, ManagedConnectionPool)` creates a `TxConnectionListener` and associates it with the `ManagedConnection` instance.
In case of `LocalTransaction` a `XAResource` is created to wrap the local transaction methods of the resource adapter.
In case of `XATransaction` the underlying `XAResource` instance is wrapped with product information, if configured. 

`getManagedConnection(Subject, ConnectionRequestInfo)` verifies that a valid transaction exists before creating a ``ManagedConnection``, since there is no point in spending resources on work that is going to be rolled back. `ironjacamar.allow_marked_for_rollback` overrides this behavior. 

`managedConnectionReconnected(ConnectionListener)` enlist the `ConnectionListener` in the transaction. 

`managedConnectionDisconnected(ConnectionListener)` delist the `ConnectionListener` from the transaction. 

`lazyEnlist(ManagedConnection)` handles lazy enlistment scenarios as defined by ``LazyEnlistableConnectionManager``. 

[[_cm_implementation_abstractconnectionlistener]]
=== AbstractConnectionListener

`AbstractConnectionListener` provides the methods that are shared across both implementations, `NoTxConnectionListener` and ``TxConnectionListener``.
This base class keeps track off the connection handles used for the associated ``ManagedConnection``. 

`connectionErrorOccurred(ConnectionEvent)` logs the application error, and flushes either the `Pool` or `ManagedConnectionPool` depending on the strategy configured. 

`controls(ManagedConnection, Object)` checks if the `ManagedConnection` and optional connection is controlled by this connection listener. 

`compareTo(Object)` is used to sort the connection listeners based on their last used time. 

[[_cm_implementation_notxconnectionlistener]]
=== NoTxConnectionListener

`NoTxConnectionListener` is the listener for `NoTransaction` scenarios. 

`connectionClosed(ConnectionEvent)` dissociates the connection handles, and if there are no handles associated anymore the `ManagedConnection` is returned to the pool. 

[[_cm_implementation_txconnectionlistener]]
=== TxConnectionListener

`TxConnectionListener` is the listener for `LocalTransaction` and `XATransaction` scenarios. 

`used()` updates the last used time, and resets the timeout value for the underlying `XAResource` if in `XATransaction` mode. 

`enlist()` enlists the `XAResource` instances in the transaction through `TransactionSynchronization` including resources picked up by the ``CachedConnectionManager``. 

`delist()` delists the `XAResource` from the transaction in interleaved scenarios. 

`dissociate()` dissociates the `ConnectionListener` with the transaction. 

`connectionClosed(ConnectionEvent)` dissociates a connection handle through `wasFreed(Object)` and returns the `ManagedConnection` in interleaved scenarios. 

`connectionErrorOccurred(ConnectionEvent)` clears any `TransactionSynchronization` object such that the `ManagedConnection` can be returned for destruction. 

`tidyup()` will rollback any left over `LocalTransaction` instance. 

`isManagedConnectionFree()` checks if there is exists a `TransactionSynchronization` object in track by transaction scenarios, since the `ManagedConnection` can't be returned in that case. 

`wasFreed(Object)` dissociates a connection handle from the ``ConnectionListener``, or resets the track by transaction flag if `null` such that the `ManagedConnection` can be returned. 

The `TransactionSynchronization` class takes care of enlisting the `XAResource` in the transaction, in track by transaction scenarios.
This is done in its `enlist()` and its result can be verified in ``checkEnlisted()``.
The `beforeCompletion()` method delists the `XAResource` from the transaction.
The `afterCompletion(int)` method returns the `ManagedConnection` to the pool.
