The deployer chains for the project is located in the `deployers` module.

[[_rardeployer]]
== RAR Deployer


The responsibility of the RAR deployer is to deploy a resource adapter archive (.RAR) file.

[[_rardeployer_fungal]]
=== Fungal


The Fungal kernel features a simple deployment framework, so only three classes are needed for the deployer chain.

The classes are located in the

[source]
----

deployers/src/main/java/org/jboss/jca/deployers/fungal
----


directory.

[[_rardeployer_fungal_radeployer]]
==== RADeployer


This class represent a resource adapter deployer and implements the

[source]
----

com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.Deployer
com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.MultiStageDeployer
com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.DeployerOrder
----


interfaces.

The responsible of the class is to

* Create a classloader for the deployment
* Retrieve metadata and annotations such that they can be merged
* Perform archive validation using the JCA validator
* Perform bean validation
* Register the metadata in the metadata repository
* Register the resource adapter in the metadata repository
* Identify and activate the resource adapter objects - if JNDI information is available
* Bind connection factories and admin objects into JNDI - if JNDI information is available


If the resource adapter isn't activated in this step based on an `ironjacamar.xml` file, the deployment will advance to the next step in the deployer chain.

[[_rardeployer_fungal_radeployment]]
==== RADeployment


This class represent a resource adapter deployment and implements the

[source]
----

com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.Deployment
----


interface.

The responsible of the class is to

* Unregister the resource adapter from the metadata repository
* Unregister the JNDI bindings in the metadata repository - if the deployment was activated
* Unbind connection factories and admin objects in JNDI - if the deployment was activated
* Close the classloader
* Clean up any temporary files


[[_rardeployer_fungal_raxmldeployer]]
==== RaXmlDeployer


This class represent a resource adapter deployer and implements the

[source]
----

com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.Deployer
com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.MultiStageDeployer
com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.DeployerOrder
com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.DeployerPhases
----


interface.

The class deploys resource adapter archives based on a `-ra.xml` which provides the necessary deployment information.

The responsible of the class is to

* Create a classloader for the deployment
* Retrieve metadata from the metadata repository
* Merge metadata from the deployment descriptor
* Perform archive validation using the JCA validator
* Perform bean validation
* Register the metadata in the metadata repository
* Identify and activate the resource adapter objects
* Bind connection factories and admin objects into JNDI


Since multiple resource adapter archives can be activated within a single `-ra.xml` file the class uses the `DeployerPhases` callbacks to unregister these from the container.
If there is only a single resource adapter activation the deployer acts as part of  the normal deployer chain.

[[_rardeployer_fungal_raxmldeployment]]
==== RaXmlDeployment


This class represent a resource adapter deployment from the `RaXmlDeployer` and implements the

[source]
----

com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.Deployment
----


interface.

The responsible of the class is to

* Unregister the JNDI bindings in the metadata repository
* Unbind connection factories and admin objects in JNDI
* Close the classloader


[[_rardeployer_fungal_raactivator]]
==== RAActivator


This class will activate all resource adapters which hasn't been deployed by a previous step.
The class implements the 

[source]
----

com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.DeployerPhases
----


interface.
This interface allows the class to hook into the deployer lifecycle of the kernel and receive callback notifications.

The responsible of the class is to

* Find any resource adapters which hasn't been deployed through the metadata repository
* Perform a deployment like `RADeployer`
* Register each deployment with the kernel through the main deployer


[[_rardeployer_fungal_raactivator_deployment]]
==== RAActivatorDeployment


This class represent a resource adapter deployment activated by the `RAActivator` and implements the

[source]
----

com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.Deployment
----


interface.

The responsible of the class is to

* Unregister the JNDI bindings in the metadata repository
* Unbind connection factories and admin objects in JNDI
* Close the classloader


[[_dsdeployer]]
== DataSource Deployer


The responsibility of the datasource deployer is to deploy a datasource deployment (-ds.xml) file.

[[_dsdeployer_fungal]]
=== Fungal


The Fungal datasource deployer chain consists of two classes.

The classes are located in the

[source]
----

deployers/src/main/java/org/jboss/jca/deployers/fungal
----


directory.

[[_dsdeployer_fungal_dsxmldeployer]]
==== DsXmlDeployer


This class represent a datasource deployer and implements the

[source]
----

com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.Deployer
----


interface.

The responsible of the class is to

* Locate metadata about JDBC in the metadata repository
* Activate each `DataSource` using `jdbc-local.rar` as a template
* Activate each `XaDataSource` using `jdbc-xa.rar` as a template


[[_dsdeployer_fungal_dsxmldeployment]]
==== DsXmlDeployment


This class represent a datasource deployment and implements the

[source]

com.github.fungal.spi.deployers.Deployment

interface.

The responsible of the class is to

* Unbind the datasource in JNDI
* Close the classloader
